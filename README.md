# CPAN Authors Guide

This will hopefully become a comprehensive guide to authoring and maintaining Perl distributions on CPAN.
In the [CPAN Report on 2021](https://neilb.org/2022/02/07/cpan-report-2022.html)
I noted that there has been a steady decline in the number of
new authors, releasing authors, and releases, year-on-year, for the last 8 years.
In the conclusion, I noted one of the things that I thought would help:

> We need a book that's a manual on how to become a good CPAN author

I wondered whether Hacktoberfest might be a way to kickstart this?

Here are the contribution rules:

* Select a topic that you think people should know about
* Add a markdown page on that topic and link it below.
* Don't worry about the order, right now let's start collecting pieces, and if we get enough,
  then I'll start adding some structure
* Each page should be short - think single page of a book
